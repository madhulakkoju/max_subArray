# max_subArray

findout the maximum sub Array of non negative numbers from an array.

Maximum sub Array is defined in terms of sum of elements in sub array.

sub Array A is greater than sub array B if sum(A) > sum(B)..

if there is a conflict, then the sub array with higher number of elements becomes the maximum.

if there is a conflict again, then the sub array with least starting index turns out to be the Greater Sub Array.

example:
array=[1,2,5,-7,2,3]
here, [1,2,5] is the maximum sub array.
